# PNEUMONIA-DETECTION

This project builds and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Structure
- `model_training.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for training and evaluating the model.
- `pneumonia_detection.h5`: Trained model saved in HDF5 format.
- `requirements.txt`: Python packages required to run the project.

## Dataset
Dataset used: [Kaggle Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia)]([https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia])
